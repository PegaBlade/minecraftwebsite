	<h3>The thing about Minecraft, is that you can build whatever you like. So, here are a few videos I found that might help you out for building cool stuff in your house.</h3>

	<h3>Instead of those tutorials, you should come up with your imagination and create some other cool stuff</h3>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h1>Update 16/6/2021</h1>
	<h3>Now, I don't build that much stuff in singleplayer anymore, now I like to play on servers.</h3>
	<h3>Now, I like to play games like bedwars, I play on the server called Jartex(top.jartex.fun). In bedwars, your goal is to destroy the enemy's bed and kill the team, If the teams bed gets destroyed, they will no longer be able to respawn.</h3>
	<h3>I have never actually won a game of bedwars yet, but I am good at speedbridging, especially when there isn't a wifi lag. The wifi lag always stops me from placing a block, and so I couldn't bridge.</h3>

	<h4>I do not have a premium Minecraft account, so I am using a cracked account.

	<h4>Wow, those 2b2t hackers and griefers are really talented. </h4><h4>One thing to say though, I don't even know how to create a mod yet</h4><a href="https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ITristan" target="_blank"><h4>iTristan</h4></a><h4> created a plugin for the developers but added a backdoor script to the mod. That way, he got admin access for about 3 days</h4>
	<h4>During that 3 days, iTristan copied an entire base in 2b2t and then moved it 4 million blocks away from the original base.</h4>
