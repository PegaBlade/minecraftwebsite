	<h3>Now, I like to play games like bedwars, I play on the server called Jartex(top.jartex.fun). In bedwars, your goal is to destroy the enemy's bed and kill the team, If the teams bed gets destroyed, they will no longer be able to respawn.</h3>
	<h3>I have never actually won a game of bedwars yet, but I am good at speedbridging, especially when there isn't a wifi lag. The wifi lag always stops me from placing a block, and so I couldn't bridge.</h3>
